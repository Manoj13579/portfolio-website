            Based in Kathmandu, Nepal with a passion for building scalable and
            user-friendly web applications. After immersing myself in online
            courses and hands-on projects, I‚Äôve developed strong expertise in
            React, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, along with a deep
            understanding of front-end and back-end technologies.
          </p>

            style={{ margin: "1rem 2rem 1rem 5rem" }}
          >
           I‚Äôve worked ona range of personal projects, including an e-commerce platform with
            Paypal integration, a renting app featuring dynamic search filters,
            and an AI chatbot using the Gemini API. I also built a responsive
            landing page for a startup to enhance their online presence. These
            projects have honed my skills in full-stack development, API
            integrations, user authentication, and creating smooth, interactive
            user experiences. I thrive on problem-solving and enjoy turning
            ideas into fully functional web applications. Whether it's building
            from scratch or improving existing solutions, I‚Äôm always eager to
            learn new technologies and stay up-to-date with industry trends.
            Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch if you'd like to
            collaborate or need a custom web solution.
